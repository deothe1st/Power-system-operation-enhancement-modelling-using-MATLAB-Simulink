This study uses MATLAB/Simulink to model renewable integration at an injection substation, combining PV and energy storage systems to enhance efficiency and reliability. Results show a 13.33% voltage stability improvement and sustained power supply during grid outages, proving strong potential for grid resilience.
This paper focuses on enhancing power system operations at the
injection substation through the integration of renewable energy, modelled
and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. The study explores the
incorporation of photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage solutions
(ESS) to improve the substation's operational efficiency and reliability. By
simulating different scenarios, including PV integration and ESS operations,
the results show a significant improvement in voltage stability, with an
average voltage profile enhancement of 13.33% across all feeders.
Additionally, the energy storage system scenario demonstrated the
capability to continue supplying power to the feeders even after the 33 kV
grid supply was cut off, further proving its effectiveness in ensuring grid
stability during disruptions. These findings suggest that renewable energy
integration, coupled with advanced control mechanisms, holds great
potential for broader application in enhancing the reliability and
sustainability of power systems.
